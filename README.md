## Project Overview

Traditional attendance systems with static QR codes allow students to take screenshots and share them with absent classmates (proxy attendance). This system prevents proxy attendance through **server-controlled dynamic QR rotation**:
- The backend generates a cryptographically secure random token with a short lifetime (60 seconds).
- The database stores **only a SHA-256 hash** of the active token.
- When a student successfully scans the QR code, the server **atomically consumes and invalidates** the token via a conditional database update.
- A fresh replacement token is generated immediately, rotating the QR code on the teacher's screen.
- Concurrency control ensures that even if multiple students scan simultaneously, no single token can mark attendance more than once.
- A compound unique database index (`sessionId` + `studentId`) ensures that a student cannot be marked present multiple times for the same session.

---

## Key Features

### For Teachers & Administrators
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Secure login with bcrypt-hashed passwords and JWT tokens.
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Real-time stats on registered students, total sessions, active sessions, and recent session logs.
- **Session Management**: Create sessions by entering Subject Name and Class/Section Name.
- **Dynamic QR Display**: Live auto-rotating QR code with a 60-second expiration countdown and manual rotation trigger.
- **Live Attendance Counter**: Real-time display of students present in the active session.
- **Attendance Reports**: Filter records by session or subject, search by student name/ID, and export reports to CSV.
- **Teacher Isolation**: Access controls prevent teachers from viewing or modifying sessions owned by other teachers.

### For Students
- **Student Registration**: Dedicated student sign-up capturing Full Name, Email, Password, and Student ID/Roll Number (role escalation prevented by backend).
- **Student Dashboard**: Real-time attendance percentage calculated from database records, attendance counter, and recent history.
- **Live Camera Scanner**: In-browser camera scanning powered by `html5-qrcode` with permission error handling and manual fallback input.
- **Single-Use Validation**: Immediate feedback on success, expired tokens, already-consumed tokens, or duplicate attendance attempts.
- **Attendance History**: Complete chronological log of attended sessions retrieved directly from MongoDB.

## Prerequisites & System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version `18.x` or `20.x` LTS (`node -v` to verify)
- **npm**: Version `9.x` or higher (`npm -v` to verify)
- **MongoDB**: Either a local MongoDB Community Server (v5.0+) or a free cloud cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
- **Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari with camera permissions enabled

---

## Database Setup (Local MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas)

### Option A: Local MongoDB Community Edition
1. Download and install MongoDB Community Server from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2. Start the MongoDB daemon:
   ```bash
   # On Linux (systemd)
   sudo systemctl start mongod

   # On macOS (Homebrew)
   brew services start mongodb-community

   # On Windows
   net start MongoDB
   ```
3. Default connection string: `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/qr_attendance`

### Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
1. Sign up for a free tier account at [mongodb.com/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
2. Create a new free cluster (M0).
3. Under **Database Access**, create a user with read/write privileges.
4. Under **Network Access**, add IP address `0.0.0.0/0` (allow access from anywhere) or your local public IP.
5. In your cluster dashboard, click **Connect** -> **Connect your application** and copy the URI:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/qr_attendance?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

---

## Installation & Setup

Clone or copy the project files to your local workspace:

```bash
cd attendance-system
```

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies
Open a terminal in the `server` directory:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies
Open a second terminal in the `client` directory:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

---

## Environment Configuration

### Backend Configuration (`server/.env`)
Copy the example environment template in `server`:
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `server/.env` with your values:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/qr_attendance
JWT_SECRET=super_secret_jwt_random_key_change_in_production_123456
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Frontend Configuration (`client/.env`)
Copy the example environment template in `client`:
```bash
cd client
cp .env.example .env
```
Editing `client/.env` is optional. The client calls `/api` on its own origin, and the Vite dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:5000`, so no configuration is needed for local development. Set `VITE_API_URL` only when the API is hosted on a different domain:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://attendance-api.example.com/api
```

---

## Database Seeding (Teacher Account)

To create or reset the administrator/teacher account, run the seed script:

```bash
cd server
npm run seed:teacher
```

**Default Seeded Teacher Credentials:**
- **Email:** `teacher@university.edu`
- **Password:** `TeacherPass123!`
- **Role:** `teacher`

*(You can customize these values by setting `SEED_TEACHER_EMAIL` and `SEED_TEACHER_PASSWORD` in `server/.env` before running).*

---

## Running the Application

Always run the backend and frontend in separate terminal windows.

### Terminal 1 — Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
# Or: npm start
```
*The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` and connect to MongoDB.*

### Terminal 2 — Start the Frontend Development Server
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
*The Vite development server will start on `http://localhost:5173`.*

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## Running Both Servers With One Command

From the repository root:
```bash
npm run setup   # installs root, server and client dependencies
npm run dev     # starts the Express API (5000) and the Vite client (5173)
```

---

## Deployment on Vercel

The repository deploys as a **single Vercel project**: Vite builds the React client into `client/dist` (served from the project domain) and the Express API runs as a serverless function at `/api/*` through `api/[...path].js`. Because the client and API share one domain, no CORS or `VITE_API_URL` setup is required.

1. Create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster (M0), allow network access from `0.0.0.0/0`, and copy the `mongodb+srv://` connection string.
2. Import the repository in Vercel with the **Other** framework preset. `vercel.json` already provides the install command, build command and output directory.
3. Add the environment variables in **Project Settings -> Environment Variables**:

   | Variable | Example | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `MONGODB_URI` | `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/qr_attendance` | Required |
   | `JWT_SECRET` | long random string | Required |
   | `CLIENT_URL` | `https://your-project.vercel.app` | Optional; same-origin requests are allowed automatically |

4. Seed the teacher account against Atlas (run once, locally):
   ```bash
   cd server
   MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://..." npm run seed:teacher
   ```
5. Deploy and open `https://your-project.vercel.app`.

`api/[...path].js` caches the MongoDB connection between invocations, and `GET /api/health` responds without requiring the database.

## End-to-End User Guide

### 1. Teacher Logs In and Creates a Session
1. Visit `http://localhost:5173/login`.
2. Sign in with the seeded teacher credentials (`teacher@university.edu` / `TeacherPass123!`).
3. Click **+ Create New Session** on the dashboard.
4. Enter the **Subject Name** (e.g., "Computer Networks") and **Class** (e.g., "CS-301-A").
5. Click **Create & Start Session**.
6. The screen displays the dynamic QR code along with a live 60-second expiration countdown and real-time attendance counter.

### 2. Student Registers and Scans Attendance
1. In another browser window (or on a mobile device on the same local network), visit `http://localhost:5173/register`.
2. Fill out Name, Student ID (`STU-001`), Email, and Password.
3. Once logged in, the student dashboard displays 0% attendance.
4. Click **Scan Attendance QR**.
5. Grant browser camera permission and aim the camera at the teacher's QR display.
6. Upon scanning:
   - The student sees a green **Attendance Recorded!** confirmation card.
   - The scanned QR code becomes immediately invalid on the server.
   - The teacher's screen rotates to a fresh replacement QR code.
   - The teacher's attendee counter increments to 1, and the student's name appears in the log.

### 3. Reviewing Reports and Exporting
1. Return to the teacher's dashboard and navigate to **Reports**.
2. Filter attendance records by Session or Subject, or search by student name/ID.
3. Click **Export to CSV** to download a spreadsheet report.

## Troubleshooting & Common Errors

### 1. `MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017`
- **Cause:** Local MongoDB service is not running.
- **Solution:** Start the MongoDB service (`sudo systemctl start mongod` on Linux, `brew services start mongodb-community` on macOS, or `net start MongoDB` on Windows). Alternatively, use a MongoDB Atlas URI in `server/.env`.

### 2. `Invalid authentication token` / HTTP 401
- **Cause:** The JWT token expired or was modified.
- **Solution:** Click **Logout** in the navigation bar and log in again with valid credentials.

### 3. Camera Permission Denied on Student Scanner
- **Cause:** The browser or operating system blocked access to the webcam or phone camera.
- **Solution:** Click the camera icon in the browser address bar, select **Always allow**, and refresh the page. Alternatively, use the **Manual Token Entry** toggle on the scan page.

### 4. `E11000 duplicate key error collection: users index: email_1`
- **Cause:** Attempting to register with an email address that already exists.
- **Solution:** Use a different email address or log in using existing credentials.

### 5. CORS Errors in Browser Console
- **Cause:** The frontend URL does not match `CLIENT_URL` in `server/.env`.
- **Solution:** Ensure `CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173` is set in `server/.env` and restart the backend server.
